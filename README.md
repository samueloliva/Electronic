# Electronic

## Problem Description
In this problem, I was required to get a class called ElectronicItem 
and separate its types into other classes (subclasses).

Class: ElectronicItem
* Types:
    * Console
    * Television
    * Microwave
    * Controller

However, some electronic items can contain extra items and other don't.

## Proposed solution
There're two ways that could handle this kind of problem: inheritance or composition
* Inheritance: derives one class from another, where classes and objects are tightly coupled 
* Composition: defines a class as the sum of its parts, where classes and objects are loosely coupled

I chose the Composition concept, due to its flexibility.
